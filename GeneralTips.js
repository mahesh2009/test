				Here are some general tips on how to protest safely, courtesy of Amnesty
				International. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with these before each protest.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<b>What To Do: </b>
				<i class="material-icons md-36" >thumb_up</i>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					{" "}
					<b>Plan ahead:</b> For essential needs, care, and supplies. Know what to
					expect. Know how to get assistance. Plan for how to re-contact your
					buddies if separated.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Be calm and focused:</b> when things get intense, react to danger and
					warning signs sooner, not later.
				</li>
				<li>
					Watch for signs of physical and mental problems in yourself and
					others. Cool down others who exhibit panic behaviour.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Document:</b> film or write down police actions, brutality and injuries.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				<b>What Not To Do: </b>
				<i class="material-icons md-36" >thumb_down</i>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Don't</b> put vaseline, mineral oil, oil-based sunscreen or moisturizers
					on skin as they can trap chemicals. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Don't</b> wear contact lenses, which can trap irritating chemicals
					underneath. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Don't</b> wear things which can easily be grabbed (i.e. jewelry, ties,
					loose hair). 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Don't</b> go alone, if you can help it - go with an affinity group or some
					friends who know you well. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Don't</b> forget to eat food and drink lots of water. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				<b>What To Bring: </b>
				<i class="material-icons md-36" >local_atm</i>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Water in a plastic water bottle with squirt top, to drink and to wash
					off your skin or eyes. 
				</li>
				<li>Energy Snacks. </li>
				<li>Identification and emergency contact information. </li>
				<li>Enough money for a pay-phone, food and transportation. </li>
				<li>Watch, paper and pens for accurate documentation of events. </li>
				<li>
					Inhaler, epipen, insulin and several days of prescription medication. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Menstrual pads. Avoid using tampons as if you're arrested you may not
					have a chance to change. 
				</li>
				<li>Basic first aid kit. </li>
				<li>Wet wipes and tissue. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				<b>Dealing With Teargas: </b>
				<i class="material-icons md-36" >fire_extinguisher</i>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Avoid use of oils and lotion because they can trap the chemicals and
					thereby prolong exposure. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Gas masks provide the best facial protection, if properly fitted and
					sealed. Alternatively, googles, respirators, or a wet bandana over the
					nose and mouth will help.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>STAY CALM.</b> Panicking increases the irritation. Breathe slowly and
					remember it is only temporary.
				</li>
				<li>
					Blow your nose, rinse your mouth, cough and spit. Try not to swallow.
				</li>
				<li>
					Wearing contacts: you must remove the lenses or get someone to remove
					them for you with CLEAN, uncontaminated fingers. Destroy the lenses
					after the exposure.
				</li>
				<li><b>DO NOT RUB IT IN</b></li>
				<li>
					Use an eye flush using a solution of half liquid antacid and half
					water. This only applies to aluminium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide. {" "}
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				<b>What To Wear: </b>
				<i class="material-icons md-48" >umbrella</i>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Shatter resistant swimming goggles and a N95 facemask. </li>
				<li>Comfortable, protective shoes that you can run in. </li>
				<li>
					Clothing covering all your skin to protect from sun and pepper spray
					exposure. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Shatter-resistant eye protection (i.e.sunglasses, swim goggles, or gas
					mask). 
				</li>
				<li>
					Bandana to cover nose and mouth soaked in water, lemon juice, or
					vinegar; it can aid in breathing during chemical exposure. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Fresh clothes in a plastic bag (in case yours get contaminated by
					chemical weapons). 
				</li>
				<li>A hat to protect you from the sun and from chemical weapons. </li>
			</ul>
